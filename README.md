# Title
Baby Name Factory - A Character-Level Text Generation Model Based on RNN and LSTM

# Purpose
This project aims at using nlp to generate a innovative name for my new-born baby

# Highlights
- Implemented the key components of RNN and LSTM from scratch, using Numpy
- Trained the model, and applied gradient clipping techniques to prevent the issue of exploding gradients during the training process
- Conducted regular sampling from the model every 2000 training steps to generate novel baby names 
- Achieved significant improvement in model performance as the generated baby names evolved from random sequences to reasonable-looking names after 22,000 training steps.
